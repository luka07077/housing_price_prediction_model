# Housing Price Prediction Model using TensorFlow/Keras
 
## Key Features:
 - Preprocessing: Dual Standardization (scales both Features X and Target y)
 - Architecture: Dense Neural Network (DNN) with Dropout & Early Stopping
 - Evaluation: Inverse transformation for real-dollar metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)
 - Visualization: Loss curves, 100sqm sample comparison, and non-luxury filtering

## Please make sure that:
 - the necessary libraries and modules are installed in your environment(conda)
 - install cmd: conda install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib
 - check cmd: conda list | grep -E "pandas|numpy|tensorflow|scikit-learn|matplotlib"
